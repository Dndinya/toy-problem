## Toy problem
These are three Projects, Speed Detector, Net salary calculator and student grade generator.
##### Description
## Net salary calculator
This system is used to get salary deductions using purely javascript. It first uses the KRA rates to tax your monthly taxable income, which should exclude your benefits and allowances. This also applies for NHIF and NSSF deductions, they are not subjected to the allowances and benefits. All the deductions are only subjected to the basic Salary. The systems runs on the node js. This makes node js installation mandatory. There is is a sample salary amount of 50000 kenyan shillings and benefits of 10000 kenyan shillings  before calling of the function "calculateNetSalary". These values are just examples to show that the system works you can use values of your choosing or that works in your situation.
I have only one main file 
1. netsalary.js

## Student grade generator
This is a student grade generator that is built using html and JavaScript. The system brings out an input window,with the text "What is your score?"  Which requests you for your marks and Ouputs a grade for your score.  The value should be between 0 and 100 else it will print out "Invalid input. Please enter a number between 0 and 100."
I have only two main files 
1. grade.js
2. grade.html
## Speed detector
This is a speed detector that is built using html and JavaScript. The system brings out an input window,with the text "Enter the speed of the car?" prompt Which requests you for speed of the car and Ouputs "Ok" if the speed is less than or equals to 70km/hr. If the speed is greater than 70km/hr it outputs the drivers demerit points and if the demerit points are greater than 12 it outputs the drivers license is suspended.This works in several ways and I decided to run  it in prompt window within the browser. If you want to check it within your terminal with node js you could change the alert() methods to console.log() and then delete the prompt method. 
 If you want want to see the workings within the console or terminal by running node js you could remove the prompt line of code and change the alerts to console.log

I have only two main files 
1. speed.js
2. speed.html
